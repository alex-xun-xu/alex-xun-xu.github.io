I am currently a senior scientist with the Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R), A-STAR, working closely with Dr. Foo Chuan-Sheng. Prior to that, I was a Research Fellow working with Prof. Lee Gim Hee in the Computer Vision and Robotic Perception (CVRP) Lab of School of Computing, Natinoal University of Singapore (NUS). I also worked with Prof. Cheong Loong Fah in Visual Interactive Media Lab of NUS from Sep 2016 to Mar 2019. I received a PhD degree from Computer Vision Group in the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at Queen Mary, University of London (QMUL), jointly supervised by Prof. Shaogang Gong and Dr. Tao Xiang. I also worked closely with Dr. Timothy Hospedales . Before joining the Computer Vision Group in QMUL I received my B.Eng in Automation from Sichuan University supervised by Prof. Yusheng Liu and Prof. Kai Liu. 
My research interests include label-efficient learning and robust AI with applications to 3D point cloud data.
