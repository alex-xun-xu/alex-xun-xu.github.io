Data release for Xu, X., Hospedales, T. and Gong, S., 2017. Transductive Zero-Shot Action Recognition by Word-Vector Embedding. International Journal of Computer Vision, pp.1-25.

Supporting Data:

Fisher Vector encoded features for HMDB51, UCF101, Olympic Sports and CCV are provided in http://pan.baidu.com/s/1pLcAweZ
Each dataset comes with three encoded descriptors, HOG, HOF and MBH. You may wish to columnwisely concatenate all three features to maxmize the performance.

50 random splits for zero-shot learning are given in http://pan.baidu.com/s/1gfGMnfX .

The labels for each video are given in http://pan.baidu.com/s/1nuU6VUT . Note, the CCV dataset is multi-labelled, i.e. each video may be associated with multiple labels.
